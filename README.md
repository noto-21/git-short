# git-short

A group of scripts that abbreviate common git commands.  To be placed in `/usr/local/bin`, via root permission (i.e., `sudo`), for ease of use.

If any problems occur with running, try updating the file permissions with `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/git-short_script`.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that you already have `git` installed on your system.  Please ensure that this is the case before attempting to use these scripts, otherwise they simply won't work.
